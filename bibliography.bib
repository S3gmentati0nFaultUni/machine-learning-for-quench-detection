	abstract = {In a triumphant report to the Royal Netherlands Academy of
	            Arts and Sciences (KNAW), Kamerlingh Onnes documented his
	            achievement in great detail. Therefore it is remarkable that
	            reliable details about his serendipitous discovery of
	            superconductivity three years later have been hard to come
	            by. Lack of information has led to speculations about the
	            discovery. In particular, it has perpetuated an apocryphal
	            tale about the role played by a sleepy young apprentice in
	            Kamerlingh Onnes’s lab. That tale was treated as established
	            fact in a September 1996 Physics Today article by Jacobus de
	            Nobel (page 40). There have even been rumors of the possible
	            disappearance of Kamerlingh Onnes’s laboratory notebooks.},
