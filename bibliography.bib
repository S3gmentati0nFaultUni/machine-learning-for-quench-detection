	            reliable details about his serendipitous discovery of
	            superconductivity three years later have been hard to come
	            by. Lack of information has led to speculations about the
	            discovery. In particular, it has perpetuated an apocryphal
	            tale about the role played by a sleepy young apprentice in
	            Kamerlingh Onnes’s lab. That tale was treated as established
	            fact in a September 1996 Physics Today article by Jacobus de
	            Nobel (page 40). There have even been rumors of the possible

	abstract = {The performances of superconducting magnets for particle
	            accelerators are limited by instabilities or disturbances
	            which lead to the transition of the superconducting material
	            to the normal resistive state and the activation of the
	            quench protection system to prevent damage to the magnet. To
	            locate the position of the state transition, voltage taps or
	            quench antennas are the most commonly used technologies for
	            their reliability and accuracy. However, during the
	            production phase of a magnet, the number of voltage taps is
	            commonly reduced to simplify the construction process and
	            quench antennas are generally used only for dipoles or
	            quadrupoles to limit the antenna design complexity. To
	            increase the accuracy in the reconstruction of the quench
	            event position, a novel method, suitable for magnets with
	            independent superconducting coils and quench protected
	            without the use of quench heaters, is proposed in this paper.
	            This method, based on standard magnetic measurement
	            techniques for field harmonic analysis, can locate the
	            position of the superconductor transition inside the magnet
	            after the quench event when the magnet has been discharged.
	            Analyzing the not allowed harmonics produced in the field
	            quality at zero current, the position of the quenched coils
	            can be retrieved for any magnet orders without increasing the
	            complexity of the dedicated measurement technique.},
