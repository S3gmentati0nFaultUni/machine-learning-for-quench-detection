	journal = {Superconductor Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The performances of superconducting magnets for particle
	            accelerators are limited by instabilities or disturbances
	            which lead to the transition of the superconducting material
	            to the normal resistive state and the activation of the
	            quench protection system to prevent damage to the magnet. To
	            locate the position of the state transition, voltage taps or
	            quench antennas are the most commonly used technologies for
	            their reliability and accuracy. However, during the
	            production phase of a magnet, the number of voltage taps is
	            commonly reduced to simplify the construction process and
	            quench antennas are generally used only for dipoles or
	            quadrupoles to limit the antenna design complexity. To
	            increase the accuracy in the reconstruction of the quench
	            event position, a novel method, suitable for magnets with
	            independent superconducting coils and quench protected
	            without the use of quench heaters, is proposed in this paper.
	            This method, based on standard magnetic measurement
	            techniques for field harmonic analysis, can locate the
	            position of the superconductor transition inside the magnet
	            after the quench event when the magnet has been discharged.
	            Analyzing the not allowed harmonics produced in the field
	            quality at zero current, the position of the quenched coils
	            can be retrieved for any magnet orders without increasing the
	            complexity of the dedicated measurement technique.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such
	            that each tree depends on the values of a random vector
	            sampled independently and with the same distribution for all
	            trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests
	            converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the
	            forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of
	            tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual
	            trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a
	            random selection of features to split each node yields error
	            rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R.
	            Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth
	            International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust
	            with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error,
	            strength, and correlation and these are used to show the
	            response to increasing the number of features used in the
	            splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure
	            variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to
	            regression.},
