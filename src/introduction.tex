\chapter{introduction}
This thesis originated as a cooperation between the departments of Computer Science and Physics of
Milan University in an attempt of confirming, or giving us a good reason to doubt, the analytical
method originally found by Samuele Mariotto in his research on the localization of quench events in
the High Order Corrector superconducting magnets that will be mounted on the \textsc{lhc} experiment for the
HiLumi upgrade \cite{mariotto2022} \cite{mariotto2022-generic}.

\smallskip

The aim of the original work was, beginning from the harmonic decomposition of the magnetic
field measured on the superconductor during operation, to find an analytical explanation for \qlp.
The aim of this thesis is to identify a model that can reliably reply to the question 'If quench
happened during the test run, which coil within the magnet did quench?' knowing the harmonic
decomposition of the magnetic field measured on the superconductor during operation. All the
analyses have been conducted posthumously.

\smallskip

In the following I will be explaining some of the studies and results obtained in the field of
quench event recognition and quench event localization by using machine learning models to abstract
patterns from the measurements of magnetic field harmonics captured by Mariotto during his own
experiments. The resulting models could be of use in the field of magnet testing and behavior
explanation for future research work in the field of magnet manufacturing.

In this document I chose to approach the matter as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item[\Cref{chp:soupcond-quench}] gives an overview of superconductivity and quench on a
		theoretical level.
	\item[\Cref{chp:ml}] gives an overview of machine learning and the various models used
		within the project on a theoretical level.
	\item[\Cref{chp:problem}] explains the challenges associated with the project, the datasets
		that have been used and the various testing and model selection procedures.
	\item[\Cref{chp:qrp}] introduces the Quench Recognition Problem, as well as the models
		utilized to solve the problem and the results obtained, alongside some
		considerations on the models' structure.
	\item[\Cref{chp:qlp}] introduces the Quench Localization Problem, the extension of previously
		obtained models to this new instance, and the final results.
	\item[\Cref{chp:future}] lists other ideas that came along while designing a solution for
		the two problems at hand.
	\item[\Cref{chp:conclusion}] closes the dissertation with some on the design and development
		processes.
