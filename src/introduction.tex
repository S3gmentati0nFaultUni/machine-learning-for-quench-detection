\chapter{introduction}
This thesis originated as a cooperation between the departments of Computer Science and Physics of
Milan University in an attempt of confirming the analytical method, originally found by
\textsc{infn} and the University of Milan superconducting research group, for the localization of
quench events in High Order Corrector superconducting magnets \cite{mariotto2022}
\cite{mariotto2022-generic} that will be mounted in the \textsc{lhc} collider machine for the High
Luminosity upgrade \cite{rossi2024} (\textsc{hl-lhc}).

The aim of the original work was, beginning from the harmonic decomposition of the magnetic
field produced by the superconducting magnet after a \emph{quench} event, which is a transition of the
material from the superconducting state to the normal conducting state, to find an analytical
explanation for the reconstructed harmonic content and correlate the information with the
localization of the quenched superconducting coil(s) in the magnet assembly. This problem will be
referred to, in this thesis, as the Quench Localization Problem (\qlp\ for short).

The aim of this thesis is to identify a model that can reliably reply to the question 'If quench
happened during the test run, which coil within the magnet did quench?' knowing the harmonic
decomposition of the magnetic field measured at the center of the magnet, where the beam will pass
in production, this magnetic field is the result of the contribution of the magnetization of the
superconducting coils and the iron yoke that locks the coils in place. The analyses have been
conducted after the quench event manifested itself, to avoid damaging the material the magnet was
tested in a protected environment, connected to a Quench Protection System, (the experiment will be
explained further in \Cref{chp:problem}).

In the following, we will be explaining some of the studies and results obtained in the field of
quench event recognition and quench event localization, using machine learning models to abstract
patterns from the measurements of magnetic field harmonics captured by the co-advisor for this
thesis, researcher Samuele, during his own experiments. The resulting models could be of use in the
field of magnet testing and behavior explanation for future research work in the field of magnet
manufacturing and magnet protection systems.
