\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I have been working on this for well over $6$ months, and I'd guess that the thing I said
the most in the last period, other than 'letteralmente', is: 'I have done everything wrong, I should
have studied physics'. Working on this project and writing this thesis allowed me to explore a
fascinating world. Particle Physics (still a machine learning course, but let's play pretend), Accelerator Physics and this thesis gave me a glimpse of the incredible complexity of our universe.

\smallskip

My bachelor thesis was not worthy of being dedicated to anybody, this time around I am going to make
the effort, and I'm going to be a bit cringe about it, but I am going to do the same thing everybody
else does, so bear with me, because it hurt me to write it as much as it hurts you to read it.

\medskip

I want to thank Lucio Rossi for being an amazing professor, with the spark in his eyes whenever he
is doing a lecture, talking about his job, or his beloved Inter team, I also want to thank Samuele
Mariotto for being always there and available, and for being a constant presence during the whole
development process. Last but not least I want to give special thanks to Dario Malchiodi, who is an
amazing teacher and an even better person, helping me understand and guiding me from the beginning
till the end of the project (I started with $0$ clue of what I had to do).

\smallskip

Of course, as anybody inevitably does, I want to thank my parents, Laura and Laurent, for not
suffocating me in my sleep and supporting me even in the most troubled of waters, I also thank my
sister, for her admirable passion and dedication, my hope is that her future can be full of light.

I want to thank all of my friends doing physics and scientific computing in Heidelberg, don't know
if they have any idea of how inspiring it was to be surrounded by such brilliant people.

I also want to the friends I had with me in the last two and a half years, at university (Gianluca,
Davide, Chiara, Ale, Lucia, Coso, Filippo, Gatto, Fabrizio and Ombre), at home (Pippo Filippo, Edo,
Francesco, Elio, Lo Slavo, Kolokao, Vincenzo, Gli Ardizzi and Alin), at the lab (Flavio,
Dario and Davide) and all the others that I am not adding for space reasons (I swear that there
is more, but I don't want to show--off).

Finally I want to thank Silke, because she was there when she was not, a ray of sunshine in my rainy
days and a lighthouse in my foggy future.

I'm almost done, I swear.

To close this off, I want to thank Tiki, for never saying a word, and I want to dedicate all of this
work to my grandparents, who have zero clue of what I'm doing, but still support it, my uncle
Alberto and my aunt Rosalba, who passed in recent years but will always live in our memories, and to LeBron
(The King) James, for being such an amazing basketball player, putting up the same numbers he did in
the prime of his career.
